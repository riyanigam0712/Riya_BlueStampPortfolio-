My project that is the smart glasses I am using a rasberry pi and it's designated camera to perform object regontiiton and then attaching on to the glasses. For my milestone I Set up and connected to the Raspberry Pi to take a picture.

This entailed: 

Inserting the Micro-SD card into the USB reader and plug it into your computer

Do the imaging for the sd card which means duplicate their configured Raspberry Pi setups, back up their systems, or quickly deploy the same OS and software on multiple devices

Enable (SSH (Secure Shell) which lets you remotely control your Raspberry Pi from another computer without needing a monitor, keyboard, or mouse connected to the Pi) 

Run terminal commands from my PC

Edit code via VS Code

Transfer files between Pi and my computer

Insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi., Put Raspberry Pi into the case

Monitor Setup via OBS and Connect the Raspberry Pi to your PC using the HDMI capture card

enable SSH and VNC and then change port number for SSH

VS Code and open it, Install the Remote - SSH extension
```python
from picamera2 import Picamera2, Preview
import time
import cv2
picam2 = Picamera2()
camera_config = picam2.create_still_configuration(main={"size": (1920, 1080)},
lores={"size": (640, 480)}, display="lores")
picam2.configure(camera_config)
#picam2.start_preview(Preview.QTGL) #Comment this out if not using desktop interface
picam2.start()
time.sleep(2)
im = picam2.capture_array()
im = cv2.cvtColor(im, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
cv2.imwrite('file.png', im)void setup() {
```
Connect the camera and use python code above to take a picture. 

I encountered a lot of challenges for my first milestone which included the VS code side bar not working, and the imaging not working on my computer. 
My next steps ...


# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)

# Starter Project

The starter project I did was the Retro Arcade Console. It was a soldering heavy project that had many interesting steps and components. First I attached the USB socket (Serves as the power source) and the Dot matrix (the screen) with soldering. Then I attached many other important components like the capacitors, buzzer and power switch. After, I attached the keys and the timers and also added a battery option for power. The console has many classic games like tetris and spaceshooter and it was pretty fun for such a small console and simple project.
